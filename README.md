 Cover: unsupervised training set sampling and compression using a diversity strategy
 Copyright Rodrigo Silva (rmsilva @ dcc.ufmg.br) 2018
 Parameters are: original training set, emst file, size of selection (optional: "noqid" to indicate that this is a classification training set)
 OUTPUT: file named "selectedset-SELSIZE.txt" written to current directory and containing the selected instances
 
 EXAMPLE:
 #> ./cover.pl train.txt emst.csv 5000 
 where áº—rain.txt is the original training set (in LETOR/MSLR10K format), "emst.csv" is the output of the "emst" program (See below) and "5000" is the desired number of instances in the final selected set.

 TRAINING FILE
 each line in the training set must be in the following (LETOR) format "LABEL QID:QIDNUM FEAT1:VAL1 FEAT2:VAL2 ... FEATM:VALM". For classification training sets, add a "noqid" parameter to the command line (i.e. "./cover.pl train.txt emst.csv 5000 noqid"). The format is similar, except that the "QID:QIDNUM" item in the line is missing.

 EMST FILE
 emst file must contain the list of edges with ascending order by size and indexed by 0 (i.e. first instance in training file is numbered 0)

 EXAMPLE EMST FILE LINE:
 # instance X	     , instance Y	  , edge length
 1.89830000000000e+04,1.90430000000000e+04,0.00000000000000e+00

 EMST file can be created using the "emst" program in mlpack (https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack or http://www.mlpack.org)
 to run emst, take the training file and convert it into a CSV containing only feature values for each instance (one vector per line), then use the program to produce a list of EMST edges  in ascending order of length

 EXAMPLE of running EMST on a Comma separated file containing all unlabeled instances:
 #> ./emst --input_file=INPUT.csv --output_file=EMST-EDGES.txt -v
